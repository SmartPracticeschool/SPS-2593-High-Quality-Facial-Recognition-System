# SPS-2593-High-Quality-Facial-Recognition-System
### High Quality Facial Recognition System
* In this project we learn how to perform facial recognition with the help of Python and Deep Learning (using OpenCV). 
* Facial recognition is the process of identifying or verifying the identity of a person using their face.
* It captures, analyzes, and compares patterns based on the person's facial details.
* High-Quality Facial Recognition System has many applications starting from mobile phones to security cameras.
* The face detection process is an essential step as it detects and locates human faces in images and videos.
* To implement facial recognition, this system compares the information that it gets with a database of known faces to find a match.
